# Clean Code Workspace

This is my repo for working through Uncle Bob's classic [Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882)

### Me

I'm a full-stack web dev, currently working in Typescript. I have a lot of varied programming experience, however my
Java is limited to a college course I took years ago.

### Java Version and Tools

I use Webstorm day-to-day so I'll be using IntelliJ, and I'm familiar with nvm/pyenv so I immediately looked for something similar for Java.

Clean Code is of course a bit dated, jvm-wise; as best I can tell was written in version 5 or 6. I'll be using
Java8, since it's the oldest LTS release - although there's a big caveat: we can't install 8 via homebrew, because of
licensing issues. So I'm using the openjdk version. As I start this project, I have no idea of the
implications of this :)

* [jenv](https://github.com/jenv/jenv)
* Java8: `brew cask install adoptopenjdk/openjdk/adoptopenjdk8`
* [IntelliJ IDEA CE](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=mac)

[Create your first Java application](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/creating-and-running-your-first-java-application.html) was helpful.

### Repo Organization

I'll be breaking everything out by chapter and keeping notes for each chapter in READMEs. I'll also be prefixing each
chapter-specific commit with the chapter and using the section title as the commit message where relevant,
e.g. `Chap14: Args: The Rough Draft`.


### Notes

* I'll be using the [The Benjamin Franklin Method of Reading Programming Books](http://www.pathsensitive.com/2018/01/the-benjamin-franklin-method-of-reading.html)
as much as possible.
